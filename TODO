Suggestions from big Brice da goat:
list_split works as intended

plot_list requires index
plot_lists makes a list of all the plots from the dataset

General Package TODO:

add better error handling to all functions

want to add testing that works with devtools::test

NEED BETTER EXAMPLES

cat_match TODO:
add an argument for when messy and clean are same length
  find a mapping with the least total distance and prevent duplicates

fix typos TODO:

Switch from percentage of typos (dist / length) to raw number of typos (dist)

idea from dk:
  string distance calculation that weights letters that are close in qwerty-space
  would work really well for same length strings

include capitilzation

setting the arguments thr and occ_ratio is tough
  should probably make a method for determining the best way
  select_metric type thing
  occ_ratio needs to be less than:
    the least common correct word / corresponding typo
  threshold needs to be more than:
    distance between most fucked typo and correct spelling

viable applications
  add handling for multiple typo matches
    c(amy, andy, amdy)
  add to vignette
