General Package TODO:

add better error handling to all functions

NEED BETTER EXAMPLES

fix typos TODO:

right now fix typos takes in a vector of strings
  should we add a way to take in df column of unique strings and column of occurence?
  maybe have a method that uses rep for the user?
  e.g. rep(clean_caterpillars$species,clean_caterpillars$count) -> clean_caterpillars_rep

idea from dk:
  string distance calculation that weights letters that are close in qwerty-space
  would work really well for same length strings


setting the arguments thr and occ_ratio is tough
  should probably make a method for determining the best way
  select_metric type thing

return a similar vector to cat match as well
  the original and what it was replaced by

OSA / DL
  use DL, probably give option for OSA

viable applications
  add handling for multiple typo matches
  add to vignette

most dl changes are 1, default value should be 1 / nchar(string)
