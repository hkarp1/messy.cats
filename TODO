General Package TODO:

add better error handling to all functions

NEED BETTER EXAMPLES
  the example in the readme doesn't even fucking work
  this works:
    select_metric(messy_v = messy_plant_categories, clean_v = plant_categories)
    cat_match(messy_v = messy_plant_categories, clean_v = plant_categories, method = "lcs")

cat_match TODO:
we can already insert select metrics into the method argument
  maybe a way to do this automatically so the function call looks nicer

create a new function cat_match_interactive and remove the overly-complicated arguments
from cat_match

fix typos TODO:

right now fix typos takes in a vector of strings
  should we add a way to take in df column of unique strings and column of occurence?
  maybe have a method that uses rep for the user?
  e.g. rep(clean_caterpillars$species,clean_caterpillars$count) -> clean_caterpillars_rep

idea from dk:
  string distance calculation that weights letters that are close in qwerty-space
  would work really well for same length strings


setting the arguments thr and occ_ratio is tough
  should probably make a method for determining the best way

return a similar vector to cat match as well
  the original and what it was replaced by

OSA / DL
  use DL, probably give option for OSA

Number of Edits
  guess n check
  find the most fucked up typo and count number of edits
  keep it simple to start
  have threshold be percentage of the word
  change >= ~90% of letters, probably not a typo

As prominence / how much more common the correctly spelled word is versus wrong word
  as either number or percent
  enter as integer for number and string for percent

viable applications
  names / words not in US dictionary
  if using basic EN words just use hunspell (https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/hunspell/versions/3.0.2/topics/hunspell)
  add handling for multiple typo matches
  add to vignette

most dl changes are 1, default value should be 1 / nchar(string)

New Function Ideas
automatically remove NULL, NA, special characters, and ""

check for plurals and singular versions of the same words and match
