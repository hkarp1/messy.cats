General Package TODO

add better error handling to all functions



fix typos TODO

right now fix typos takes in a vector of strings
  should we add a way to take in df column of unique strings and column of occurence?
  maybe have a method that uses rep for the user?
  e.g. rep(clean_caterpillars$species,clean_caterpillars$count) -> clean_caterpillars_rep

idea from dk:
  string distance calculation that weights letters that are close in qwerty-space

setting the arguments thr and occ_ratio is tough
  should probably make a method for determining the best way

OSA / DL
  use DL, probably give option for OSA

Number of Edits
  guess n check
  find the most fucked up typo and count number of edits
  keep it simple to start
  have threshold be percentage of the word
  change >= ~90% of letters, probably not a typo

As prominence / how much more common the correctly spelled word is versus wrong word
  as either number or percent
  enter as integer for number and string for percent

viable applications
  names / words not in US dictionary
  if using basic EN words just use hunspell (https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/hunspell/versions/3.0.2/topics/hunspell)
  add handling for multiple typo matches
  add to vignette
