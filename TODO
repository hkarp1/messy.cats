General Package TODO:

add better error handling to all functions

want to add testing that works with devtools::test

NEED BETTER EXAMPLES

fix typos TODO:

idea from dk:
  string distance calculation that weights letters that are close in qwerty-space
  would work really well for same length strings

setting the arguments thr and occ_ratio is tough
  should probably make a method for determining the best way
  select_metric type thing

return a similar vector to cat match as well
  the original and what it was replaced by

OSA / DL
  use DL, probably give option for OSA

viable applications
  add handling for multiple typo matches
    c(amy, andy, amdy)
  add to vignette

most dl changes are 1, default value should be 1 / nchar(string)
